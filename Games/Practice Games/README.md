## Gameplay

The game is simple, just like the original Simon Says. You'll have 4 buttons, each with a different color (red, blue, green, and yellow). Your objective is to replicate the sequence of colors presented by the computer.

To start the game, you'll need to press the space bar as indicated in the instructions. Afterward, you'll be taken to the game interface where you can interact with the 4 buttons mentioned earlier. First, it will be the computer's turn, during which it will give you the beginning of the sequence, and that's when the game begins.

The computer will illuminate a sequence of buttons, starting with just one. Your task is to reproduce the exact sequence in the correct order. Press the buttons in the same sequence as shown by the computer, and watch as your streak gets higher! But beware, with each successful replication, the difficulty level increases. The computer will challenge your memory by adding more colors to the sequence.

If you choose the wrong pattern, you'll lose. It's as simple as that. Every mistake brings with it the sting of defeat, reminding you of the importance of focus and precision. At the end youÂ´ll be shown your last _streak_ and your _highest streak_
