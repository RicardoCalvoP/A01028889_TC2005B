# Entendiendo el GDD

Summary:

In the article "How to Write First Game Design Document," it talks about the importance of having a good GDD with your team, mostly because you can land all your ideas into one. This way, we are in the same game and not in the perspective each member of the team has of the game.

It's important to say that the GDD needs to be precise, organized, and labeled with topics. This way, it's easy to group members to understand what's going on and in which direction the game is going.

It's like an organized, polished brainstorm.Essentially, the GDD functions as a meticulously refined repository of ideas, to an organized brainstorming session. It serves as a blueprint that delineates the game's essence, mechanics, and narrative, providing a roadmap for its development journey.

It's important to remember that the GDD needs to be friendly for the customer. This means it doesn't need to be so technical but fun to read instead. Moreover, it's imperative to tailor the GDD to cater to the audience, ensuring accessibility and engagement. While elucidating intricate game mechanics, it's essential to maintain a balance between technicality and readability, captivating potential players without overwhelming them with jargon.

How am I going to contribute in my GDD:

Just like my team, I'll work on most parts of the GDD. However, I would like to work more on the UI development, where we explain how the user is going to be playing our game.

Also, I would like to work on the design of the game (the cards, background).
